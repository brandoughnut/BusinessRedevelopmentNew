Comments: Website looks really cool so good job! I noticed a few flaws in different areas. 
-Desktop: 
    > On the Sizzling Plate / Sukiyaki menu page, the menu boxes aren't the same length so it looks a little unproffessional 
    > Udon menu page could probably be formatted in a more symetric design. The bottom right ramen photo is used to fill up the empty space but it looks a little weird.
-Mobile:
    -Navbar hamburger is cutoff on the bottom when clicked
Other than that everything looks very nice. I love how you guys did your header, footer, and just the overall style of the site. Really good job!!!
